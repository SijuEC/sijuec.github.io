  Data Analyst with 5+ of experience in analytics, strategy, and sales. I have developed a solid foundation in data-driven decision-making and business process improvement. Currently, I am in the final stages of obtaining my Master's Degree in Data Science from Liverpool John Moores University, with my thesis under evaluation. This academic pursuit is a strategic step towards transitioning my career towards data science. My practical experience as an analyst combined with advanced data science education prepares me well for addressing complex data challenges and contributing effectively in a more technically-focused role.
