Anomaly Localization is the task of highlighting the defect in an image of a part. In this project I improved the performance of the <a href="https://github.com/zhangzilongc/MMR">Masked Multi-scale Reconstruction</a> model, using a novel masking technique.

Cleaning the weight data in BiLL of Materials is a tedious and repetetive task. I created an intuitive and interactive web-based tool to ease this task at Recaro Aircraft Seating. Above, you can see the tool in action. This tool enables the weight team at Recaro to do this task in less than 30% of the time. This tool is deployed on an internal server and provides a seemless experience to the weight analysts across the different global sites of Recaro, i.e., Germany, USA, Poland and China.
