## Analytics

### Bill of Material weight data cleaning tool

At Recaro Aircraft Seating, I have streamlined the ,once-tedious, process of cleaning weight data in the Bill of Materials. My intuitive web-based tool significantly reduces the task time by 70%, providing a smooth experience for the weight team. Deployed on an internal server, it effectively supports weight analysts at our global sites in Germany, USA, Poland, and China, enhancing efficiency with its user-friendly interface.

### Website Traffic Dashboard

I created a dashboard for a well known EU electronics repair price comparison website. The dashboard provides an intuitive overview of their main KPIs and the flow of traffic through the website. This helps the customer get a good understanding the impact of their various marketing campaigns. They are now completely switiching over to this dashboard from google analytics.
