Cleaning the weight data in BiLL of Materials is a tedious and repetetive task. I created an intuitive and interactive web-based tool to ease this task at Recaro Aircraft Seating. This tool enables the weight team at Recaro to do this task in less than 30% of the time. This tool is deployed on an internal server and provides a seemless experience to the weight analysts across the different global sites of Recaro, i.e., Germany, USA, Poland and China.

## Website Traffic Dashboard

I created a dashboard for a well known EU electronics repair price comparison website. The dashboard provides an intuitive overview of their main KPIs and the flow of traffic through the website. This helps the customer get a good understanding the impact of their various marketing campaigns. They are now completely switiching over to this dashboard from google analytics.
